# 3.6.0
#### New

- Present modes are rewritten to shader based
- Shader API (for deep players)

- Register some node member variables to DevTools
#### Bugfix
- Fix setup item title issue of the advanced mod menu
- Fix the uncomfortable scrolling item tabs scroller issue
- Optimized codes and mod desc
#### Note
- DevTools menu is for debug use, by editing them in game you agree to take all possible risks by your own
- You can set the opacity to zero and your progress bars will be total invisible, but your being toxic or not is none of my business :/

#### ToDo

#### <cy>Better settings UI!</c>
- Former setting UI is too complex and confusing ~~even a bit buggy~~, I'm sry 4 that.  
- Also such config menu logic will be inherited to the next Chroma Icons update.
