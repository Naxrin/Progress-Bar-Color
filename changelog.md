# 3.6.0
#### New
- Chromatic / Rainbow like bars! Chroma Icons side-note I mean
- Opacity included in color config
- Present modes are rewritten to shader based
- Shader API (for deep players)
- Common Settings are moved to mod menu (your previous data are once-time ported and will keep working after update)
- Register some node member variables to DevTools
#### Bugfix
- Fix setup item title issue of the advanced mod menu
- Fix the uncomfortable scrolling item tabs scroller issue
- Optimized codes and mod desc
#### Note
- DevTools menu is for debug use, by editing them in game you agree to take all possible risks by your own
- You can set the opacity to zero and your progress bars will be total invisible, but your being toxic or not is none of my business :/
- This is an early release since shader based rewrite, so there may be countless bugs I've not ever met yet.
#### ToDo
- I should add a preview node in mod menu right?

# 3.5.0
- Less toxic list progress logic (goodbye regex match)
- Customize unfeatured lists' progress bars individually
- Fix the issue that unfeatured lists' progress are all considered zero
- Real time refresh in list rewards claimed
#### Note
- Rainbow like bars soon

#### <cy>Better settings UI!</c>
- Former setting UI is too complex and confusing ~~even a bit buggy~~, I'm sry 4 that.  
- Also such config menu logic will be inherited to the next Chroma Icons update.
#### <cy>Compatible with Overcharged Menus</c>
- The two mods won't fight now.  
- Also in this update huge effort is made to avoid crash if any mods conflict with it again in the future.
