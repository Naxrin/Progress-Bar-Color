# ProgressBarColor
This mod lets you customize your progress bar color!  
You can set your normal/practice/quest progress bar manually or follow your player colors.  
Note that follow dual color needs Weebify's Separate Dual Icons to be loaded or my own mod applies your main player's color.  
  
### Notice
2.2.0 update reconstructed settings system and your former settings are lost. sry but I'm too lazy to port them.  
  
### ToDo
- More modes (rainbow like/...)
- List progress (perhaps)
