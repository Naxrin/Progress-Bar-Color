# ProgressBarColor

This mod lets you customize your progress bar color!You can set your normal/practice/quest progress bar manually or follow your player colors.  

### Notice
After 2.2.0 update setting system are reconstructed and your former settings are lost. sry but I'm too lazy to port them.  

### ToDo
- More modes (rainbow like/gradient regarding percentage/...)
- List progress (perhaps)
