# Progress Bar Color
This mod lets you customize your progress bar color!  
You can set your normal/practice progress bar manually or follow your player colors.  
Note that follow dual color needs Weebify's Separate Dual Icons to be loaded or my own mod applies your main player's color. 

### Supports:

- Quest Progress Bars;
- List Progress Bars;

### Modes:
- Default: as if mod not loaded;
- Follow: follow player's color;
- Manual: Pick the color by your own;
- Progress: gradient relative with current percentage there;
- Random: As this word says.

**I know fetching list progress by regex match is stupid but I mean RobTop is not even willing to contain a member variable telling me completed level count and the list is Claimed or not.**
